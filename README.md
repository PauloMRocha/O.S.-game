# Operating Systems Game ðŸŽ®

## A simple game in C++ to learn about threads ðŸ§µ and semaphores ðŸš¦! 

### :books: SSC0140 - Operating Systems (USP - ICMC)

- A thread is a basic unit of CPU utilization, consisting of a program counter, a stack, and a set of registers, (and a thread ID.)

- Traditional processes have a single thread of control.

- A semaphore is a variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes in a concurrent system such as a multitasking operating system.

- In this game, we will use those concepts to create a really fun mechanic! ðŸ¥³

- This is a simple console line game done in C++ using ncurses. The main goal implementing this project is to learn and apply multi-threads in a single process.

# The game
In a post-quarantine world, a USP-SÃ£o Carlos student, leaving the classrom after a intense O.S class, needs to await the opening of the big-tray. The great problem is that the little-stage is infested with party sellers, so our great USP student must avoid those sellers to not infect himself.

The game mechanics are heavy based in the Back Off Barbarian minigame featured in Castle Crashers.
