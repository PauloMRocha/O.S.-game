## A simple game in C++ to learn about threads ðŸ§µ and semaphores ðŸš¦! 

### :books: SSC0140 - Operating Systems (USP - ICMC)

- A thread is a basic unit of CPU utilization, consisting of a program counter, a stack, and a set of registers, (and a thread ID.)

- Traditional processes have a single thread of control.

- A semaphore is a variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes in a concurrent system such as a multitasking operating system.

- In this game, we will use those concepts to create a really fun mechanic! ðŸ¥³
